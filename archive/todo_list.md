# TODO List - AI-Powered Extraction v3 System

## High Priority Items

### 1. Unit Testing Implementation
**Priority: High**

Implement comprehensive unit tests following the priority structure outlined in `test_requirements_priority.md`.

**Next Steps:**
- Start with Priority 1 tests (PDF processing, AI detection, ChromaDB integration)
- Create test fixtures and mock data
- Set up automated testing pipeline
- Target 90% code coverage for critical components

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**Priority: High**

Improve error handling across all components, especially for AI provider failures and network issues.

**Implementation:**
- Add retry logic for AI API calls
- Implement graceful degradation when AI providers are unavailable
- Enhanced logging and error reporting
- User-friendly error messages in Web UI

### 3. Performance Optimization
**Priority: Medium**

Optimize processing speed and memory usage for large PDF files.

**Areas for improvement:**
- Chunked PDF processing for memory efficiency
- Parallel processing for multi-page documents
- Caching mechanisms for repeated operations
- Database query optimization

## Feature Enhancements

### 4. Advanced Novel Extraction
**Priority: Medium**

Enhance the novel content extraction system with more sophisticated analysis.

**Features to add:**
- Character relationship mapping
- Plot structure analysis
- Setting and world-building extraction
- Dialogue pattern analysis
- Narrative style identification

### 5. Multi-Format Support
**Priority: Medium**

Extend beyond PDF support to handle other document formats.

**Formats to support:**
- EPUB (electronic books)
- MOBI (Kindle format)
- TXT (plain text)
- DOCX (Word documents)
- HTML (web content)

### 6. Advanced Search and Analytics
**Priority: Low**

Implement advanced search capabilities and content analytics.

**Features:**
- Semantic search across collections
- Content similarity analysis
- Trend analysis across game systems
- Advanced filtering and faceted search
- Export capabilities for analysis

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

### 7. Code Refactoring
**Priority: Low**

Refactor code for better maintainability and performance.

**Areas to address:**
- Consolidate duplicate code across modules
- Improve type hints and documentation
- Standardize error handling patterns
- Optimize import statements and dependencies

### 8. Documentation Updates
**Priority: Low**

Keep documentation current with system changes.

**Documentation to update:**
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Developer setup instructions
- Architecture diagrams
- Troubleshooting guides

### 9. Security Enhancements
**Priority: Medium**

Implement security best practices for production deployment.

**Security measures:**
- API key encryption and secure storage
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure file upload handling

## Infrastructure and Deployment

### 10. Containerization
**Priority: Low**

Create Docker containers for easy deployment and scaling.

**Components to containerize:**
- Main extraction application
- Web UI application
- Database services (MongoDB, ChromaDB)
- AI service proxies

### 11. Monitoring and Logging
**Priority: Medium**

Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging.

**Monitoring features:**
- Application performance metrics
- Database performance monitoring
- AI API usage tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- User activity analytics

### 12. Backup and Recovery
**Priority: Medium**

Implement robust backup and recovery procedures.

**Backup strategy:**
- Automated database backups
- Configuration backup
- Extracted content archival
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Data retention policies

## File Organization Guidelines

### Core Application Files (Keep in Root)
- Main extraction scripts (`Extraction.py`)
- Web UI components (`ui/` folder)
- Core modules (`Modules/` folder)
- Configuration files (`.env.sample`, `requirements.txt`)
- Primary documentation (`README.md`)

### Archive Folder (Non-Integral Tools)
- Enhancement scripts (`enhance_existing_content.py`)
- Testing utilities (`test_*.py`, `demo_*.py`)
- Experimental features
- Legacy tools
- Documentation files (`*.md` except README.md)

### Move enhance_existing_content.py to Archive
**Priority: Low**

The `enhance_existing_content.py` file should be moved to the `archive/` folder since it's not integral to the core application functionality.

**Rationale:**
- Non-integral tools should be placed in archive folder rather than app root
- Keeps main directory clean and focused on core functionality
- Archive folder is appropriate for utility scripts and tools

### ISBN Extraction from PDFs
**Priority: Medium**

Implement ISBN number extraction from PDFs to prevent duplicate imports using the unique ISBN identifier.

**Features to implement:**
- ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 detection
- Duplicate checking against database
- ISBN validation and formatting
- Metadata storage for future reference

### Content Type Selection Enhancement
**Priority: High**

Improve the content type selection system for better novel vs source material handling.

**Enhancements needed:**
- More sophisticated content type detection
- Custom extraction workflows per content type
- Enhanced metadata schemas
- Better categorization algorithms

## Completed Items ✅

- ✅ Basic AI-powered extraction system
- ✅ Multi-game support (D&D, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, etc.)
- ✅ Web UI with drag-and-drop upload
- ✅ ChromaDB and MongoDB integration
- ✅ Claude AI integration for book detection
- ✅ Text quality enhancement system
- ✅ Building blocks extraction for novels
- ✅ Multi-collection management
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ GitHub repository setup with proper security

## Notes

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch for each TODO item
2. Implement with comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation
4. Create pull request for review
5. Merge to main after approval

### Priority Guidelines
- **High**: Critical for core functionality or user experience
- **Medium**: Important for system robustness and features
- **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements and optimizations

### Resource Allocation
- Focus on High priority items first
- Medium priority items for next development cycle
- Low priority items for maintenance cycles

This TODO list should be reviewed and updated regularly as the system evolves and new requirements emerge.
