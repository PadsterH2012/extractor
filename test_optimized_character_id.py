            Thomas Covenant was a writer. He lived alone in a house outside the city, 
            struggling with his leprosy and his divorce from Joan. His son Roger was 
            just a baby when Joan left him. The disease had taken two fingers from his 
            right hand, and with them, it seemed, his ability to believe in anything.
            
            Dr. Berenford had been treating his condition for years. The doctor was 
            one of the few people who understood the psychological impact of leprosy 
            in the modern world. "You must be careful, Thomas," he would say. "The 
            disease affects more than just your body."

            The Land was a place of wonder and terror. High Lord Elena ruled from 
            Revelstone, the great stone city carved into the mountain. She was

            Saltheart Foamfollower, the Giant, had been Covenant's guide and friend. 
            His laughter could shake the mountains, but his sorrow ran deeper than
